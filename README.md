Rubix Solver uses an 3-dimensional array representation of a 3x3 Rubix Cube to solve, both algorithmically and recursivly, the cube.

The program takes 6 command line arguments representing the scrambled sides.

Once computationally completed, a string of Standard Rubix Notation will be printed out indicating how to solve the cube.
